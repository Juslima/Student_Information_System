## Overview

This project involves developing a C++ application for a Student Information System. The system allows users to add new students, manage their courses and grades, calculate GPAs, and display student details in a user-friendly interface.

## Key Features

- **Student Data Management:** Users can add new students with details such as name, ID, courses, and grades.

- **Accurate GPA Calculations:** The system calculates GPAs based on the grades entered for each course.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The program provides a text-based menu for users to interact with, allowing them to add students, display student details, and exit the program.

- **Initial Students:** The program is preloaded with initial student data for demonstration purposes.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-information-system.git
   ```

2. Compile the C++ program.
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o sis
   ```

3. Run the executable.
   ```bash
   ./sis
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the Student Information System.

## Special Features

- **Data Persistence:** (To be implemented) The system will include secure storage mechanisms for data persistence.

- **Advanced Search, Filter, and Sorting:** (To be implemented) Users will have options for advanced search, filter, and sorting of student information.

- **Basic User Authentication, Data Validation, and Robust Error Handling:** (To be implemented) The system will include basic user authentication, data validation, and robust error handling for enhanced reliability.
